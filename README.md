1. Introduction
The exchange of second-hand goods and the organization of student events are common activities within university communities. However, the absence of secure and user-oriented digital platforms to support these activities presents a notable gap. The UniBazaar Lite project addresses this issue by providing a web-based application that allows university students to list and browse second-hand items, as well as view and engage with campus events. The primary objective of the project is to facilitate student interaction and resource sharing in a way that contributes to a more connected and active campus environment. The application is designed with an emphasis on usability and security to ensure a reliable experience for its users.
2. Technologies Used
This project utilizes various technologies and tools to facilitate and accelerate modern web application development processes. The primary technologies chosen for the project and their purposes are summarized below:
● ASP.NET Core: Used as the main framework for the project. It offers a flexible and scalable structure with both MVC Controller and Razor Pages support.
● C#: The primary programming language chosen for all backend coding. Its strong type system and compatibility with the .NET ecosystem enable secure and rapid development.
● In-Memory Repository: An in-memory repository structure was used for fast data management during the development and testing phases. This allowed for testing the basic functionalities of the application without the need for an external database.
● Custom Middleware and Filters: Custom middleware and action filters were developed to monitor user activities and perform specific validation processes.
● Cookie Authentication: ASP.NET Core's Cookie Authentication mechanism was used for user authentication.
● .NET 9.0: The project was developed on the latest .NET version, thereby leveraging the newest features in terms of performance and security.
These technologies have ensured that the project is developed securely and sustainably. Furthermore, the open-source nature and community support allowed for quick solutions to encountered problems.
